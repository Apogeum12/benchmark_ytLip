# Benchmark simulating biological Neuron Model:
Multicore cpu and gpu Benchmark. But in fact it is simulation hodgkin huxley model neuron. Where for computing Ordinary Differential Equations i used Differentiable ODE solver method.
## Frist Version is as jupyter Notebook
Plan
- Notebook cpu version (DONE)
- Support gpu (DONE)
- Shell Script (In Progress)
- App Linux
- App Windows
- ...
